# Museum of Self

# project idea 
Museum of Self is a private, intentional MERN-stack digital sanctuary designed for personal reflection and life-phase curation. Unlike traditional social media platforms that prioritize public sharing and "infinite scrolls," this application is built for the individual
(the Curator).

The core philosophy of the Museum of Self is that our history is not a flat list of dates, but a series of rooms we walk through. By organizing memories into Life Phases, users can preserve the distinct "vibe" of different chapters of their lives.

# Key Conceptual Pillars

### Intentional Curation:
 Memories are not just "posts." They are labeled as Artifacts, Exhibits, or Centerpieces, dictating their visual scale and importance within the gallery.

### The Theme Engine:
 Every Life Phase is assigned a unique theme color. When a user enters a phase, the entire interface transitions to reflect that period's emotional atmosphere.

### Layered Perspective:
 Through the Reflection system, users can revisit old memories and add new layers of thought, creating a chronological dialogue between their past and present selves.

### Privacy & The Vault:
 Security is handled through a dual-layer system. A standard login provides access to the museum, while a secondary MasterPIN protects "The Vault"—a space for sensitive memories and time capsules locked until a future date.

### Golden Threads: 
Users can track long-term themes (like "Growth," "Career," or "Family") that span across multiple life phases, revealing the hidden patterns in their personal journey.
